            <p>Utopian is the place where contributors converge, connect, collaborate and discover projects to work on. Quickly learn how to share the work that you are doing for an Open Source project with the community.</p>
        <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
            <p>To start sharing your work with the Utopian community, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="#">create a Steem account</a>. That is the Steem account you will login with on Utopian, using your private key (active or owner key, or master password) via the secure, Steemit Inc. operated signing service <strong>SteemConnect</strong>. Once you&rsquo;re logged in, you can start making posts.</p>

                            <p>We recommend linking your GitHub account to your Utopian account so that you can easily reference your pull requests and projects, among other things.

This section doesn&rsquo;t show up when you&rsquo;re using Utopian in mobile view. <a href="#">Learn how to integrate your GitHub account</a>.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/write_tags.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
                <p>Tags allow your post to be searchable on Utopian and it is necessary to only use tags that are relevant to the contribution you are making. Examples of tags are: <em>bugs, design, logo, copywriting or translation</em>.</p>
            <h2 id="choose-your-reward-option">Choose your reward option</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/write_reward.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
                <p>Utopian gives you two ways in which to receive your STEEM rewards.</p>
                <h3 id="1-50-sbd50-steem-power-default">1) 50% SBD,50% STEEM POWER (default)</h3>
                    <p>This option gives you 50% of your rewards in SBD, which is a form of liquid STEEM. It can be transferred and spent immediately. You can trade it for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, and ultimately exchange it for the fiat currency of your choice.</p>
                    <p>The other 50% will be in Steem Power, which is STEEM that is bound to a smart contract that lets you withdraw your STEEM in 13 weekly amounts. Steem Power has a lot of utility in the Utopian ecosystem, and <a href="#">more information about its importance is available in the knowledge base</a>.</p>
                <h3 id="2-100-steem-power">2) 100% STEEM POWER</h3>
                    <p>This option gives you all your rewards in the form of Steem Power, which you can withdraw through a 13 week schedule by &ldquo;powering down&rdquo; your Steem account. <a href="#">Learn more about the Steem blockchain&rsquo;s economic model</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="submitting-the-contribution">Submitting the contribution</h2>
                <p>Once you&rsquo;re done writing your contribution and have added enough metadata, and selected your reward option, you can now submit your contribution to the Utopian moderation team by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking <strong>Post</strong>.</p>
                <p>If you have left out any important fields or entered incorrect data, your submission will not go through. The relevant fields will be highlighted in red and an explanation of the error shown next to them.</p>
                <p>If all the required fields are met, your contribution will be placed in queue to be reviewed by the moderators. You&rsquo;ll see a message on the page informing you of this, as shown in the image below. <a href="#">Learn why Utopian has moderators.</a></p>
                <img src="assets/img/write_submission.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        <hr />
       
        <h1 id="the-review-process">The review process</h1>
            <p>When your contribution has been submitted successfully, expect your work to be reviewed by one of Utopian&rsquo;s moderators within a few hours. Moderators check your submission for compliance with Utopian&rsquo;s rules and quality expectations. They will leave a comment on your post if your submission needs to be corrected in any way.</p>
            <h2 id="common-reasons-for-moderator-rejection-include">Common reasons for moderator rejection include:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrong category: you placed your contribution in the wrong category and will need to change it to the correct one</li>
                <li>Duplicate submission: your submission is for work or an issue that you or someone else has already submitted before (common with bug reports)</li>
                <li>Failure to meet quality expectations: every category has its own expectations for quality with some categories requiring specific content like pull requests, charts, links or other things that compile to form a complete submission with sufficient proof of work.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="responding-to-moderator-requests">Responding to moderator requests</h2>
            <p>A way to view all your submissions that are pending review directly on Utopian is currently being developed. For now, you can view all your posts (pending or not) on your Steemit profile page. For example, <a href="https://www.steemit.com/@imwatsi">https://www.steemit.com/@imwatsi</a> where @*** is your Steem username. Steemit pulls its data from the Steem blockchain, which includes posts made via Utopian.</p>
            <p>Check if there are any new replies to your post. Moderators write a comment on your post with instructions on how to correct your submission. To edit your contribution, open the post on Steemit and then copy the URL. For example, <a href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@imwatsi/utopian-and-the-power-of-collective-focus">https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@imwatsi/utopian-and-the-power-of-collective-focus</a>.</p>
            <p>Then change the first part of the URL from steemit.com to utopian.io. So the final URL would be <a href="https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@imwatsi/utopian-and-the-power-of-collective-focus">https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@imwatsi/utopian-and-the-power-of-collective-focus</a>.</p>
            <p>This will take you to the page where you can edit your entry, by clicking the <strong>&hellip;</strong> menu button near the post title, and selecting <strong>Edit post</strong>. You&rsquo;ll be taken back to the editor where you can make the necessary changes. Once you&rsquo;re done editing, scroll to the bottom and click <strong>Update post</strong>.</p>
        <hr /> 
            
        <h1 id="your-accepted-contribution">Your accepted contribution</h1>
            <p>Once your contribution is accepted, it will be visible on the Utopian platform and eligible for being upvoted by the Utopian bot. It will be published on the Steem blockchain and will forever be available on the blockchain.</p>
            <h2 id="how-much-will-it-make">How much will it make?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your accepted contribution has the opportunity to get a vote from the Utopian voting bot itself and from the rest of the community. As far as the Utopian voting bot is concerned, it uses algorithms to valuate the value of your post in relation to the other posts. Of course, value is an objective thing but the Utopian bot tries to distribute rewards fairly by using these algorithms. So it will upvote your contribution based on how much value it calculates you bring to the platform. Other opportunities to earn exist as when other members of the community upvote your content or when project owners send you some STEEM as rewards.</li>
                    <li>After all is said and done, how much your contribution makes is determined mostly by the quality of your work and other agreements you may have with project owners.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2 id="when-you-will-get-paid">When you will get paid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Steem blockchain distributes rewards to contributors automatically, seven days after the day on which the post was published.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the rewards option you choose when publishing the post, your rewards will either be in Steem Power alone or both Steem Power and Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD). Both of these can be traded for other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, though Steem Power requires more time to withdraw. <a href="#">Learn more about managing your STEEM wallet</a></li>
