# When does the bot vote come?

It is hard to judge and specify the timing of the Utopian Bot because it varies constantly. STEEM has a metric called "Voting Power" deciding how effective your votes are, and this metric goes up and down depending on your voting.
Utopian Bot waits for the voting power to increase to 100%, then starts voting posts as much as possible. Then, it waits for the voting power to increase to 100% again, and starts all over.
