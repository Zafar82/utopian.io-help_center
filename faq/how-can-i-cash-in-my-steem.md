# How do I cash in my STEEM?

Once you have some STEEM in your wallet, you can transfer it to a cryptocurrency exchange that supports STEEM like Poloniex or Bittrex. There you can exchange it for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are easier to exchange for fiat (USD for example).

Or you can use Blocktrades, which is integrated into the Steemit wallet interface. Just click your STEEM balance and a dropdown menu will appear. Then click “Sell” and you'll be taken to Blocktrades.
