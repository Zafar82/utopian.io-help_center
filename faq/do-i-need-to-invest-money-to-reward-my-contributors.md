# Do I need to invest money to reward my contributors?

Currently, Utopian rewards all contributions made on the platform that are approved by moderators. In the near future however, project owners will have the choice to have sponsors allocate a specific amount of voting power to their projects. As sponsors delegate Steem Power, they will be presented with the chance to specify how they want their voting power to be distributed amongst the various open source projects.

As project owners, it will your responsibility to enlist sponsors to your project, either internally (those already on Utopian) or by finding sponsors who will purchase Steem Power and delegate it to your project directly. There will be default rewards however, as explained below.


### Default voting rewards

Even if they don't have any sponsors who specify Steem Power allocations, all contributions can be rewarded through Utopian's default voting system, which votes for all accepted contributions belonging to projects that have not been allocated voting power. However, these cannot be guaranteed to be high and may not be enough to support your project to the fullest.
