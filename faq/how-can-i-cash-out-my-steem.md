# How can I cash out my STEEM?

Once you have some STEEM in your wallet, you can transfer it to a cryptocurrency exchange that supports STEEM like [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), [Changelly](https://changelly.com) or [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). There you can exchange it for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are easier to exchange for fiat (USD for example).

Or you can use [Blocktrades](https://blocktrades.us/), which is integrated into the Steemit wallet interface. Just click your STEEM balance and a dropdown menu will appear. Then click “Sell” and you'll be taken to Blocktrades.
