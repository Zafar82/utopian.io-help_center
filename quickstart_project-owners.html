            <p>Utopian helps connect project owners with valuable contributors, expediting the project development process. Make task requests for your project and find the right people to work with.</p>
        <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
            <p>To bring your project to the Utopian community, you first need to <a href="#">create a Steem account</a>. This is the Steem account you will login with on Utopian, using your private key (active or owner key, or master password) via the secure, Steemit Inc. operated signing service <strong>SteemConnect</strong>.</p>
        <h1 id="link-your-github-account">Link your GitHub account</h1>
            <p>Once your Steem account is setup and you&rsquo;ve successfully logged in, the next step is to link your GitHub account with your Utopian account. To do this, go to the <strong>GitHub Connection</strong> section, in the right side panel, and click <strong>Synch with GitHub</strong>.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/sync_github_button.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
            <p>This will take you to the following screen, if you are already logged in to GitHub:</p>
            <img src="assets/img/sync_github_prompt.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
            <p><em>If you&rsquo;re not logged in to GitHub, you will be asked to sign in.</em></p>
            <p>This asks you to verify that you are giving Utopian access to your GitHub account. It also lists the types of data that Utopian will have access to. To continue synchronizing your account, click <strong>Authorize utopian-io</strong>.</p>
            <p>It should take a few seconds to link your accounts and you will be brought to your Projects page afterwards, where all your repositories will now be listed.</p>
        <h1 id="your-projects">Your projects</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/projects_list.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
            <p>To make your way to the Projects page from elsewhere on Utopian, click the <strong>Projects</strong> tab on the navigation menu. The Projects page will open, listing all the projects/repositories you currently have on GitHub.</p>
            <p>Clicking an individual project will take you to that particular project&rsquo;s page, where you&rsquo;ll find all the project&rsquo;s activities, which include task requests you&rsquo;ve made and contributions submitted. You will also have the option to create a new task request for the project.</p>
        <h1 id="creating-a-task-request">Creating a task request</h1>
            <p>A task request is an announcement you make detailing what your project needs and how contributors can help you get it done.</p>
            <p>To create a new task request, click &ldquo;Add task request&rdquo; near the name of the project you&rsquo;re viewing, at the top of the page.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/tasks_new.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
            <p>Note: You must be on your project&rsquo;s page, as described above, to see the option to add a task request for it. You can also click the blue icon beside your project&rsquo;s name, in the &ldquo;GitHub Connection&rdquo; section, on the right side of the page.</p>
            <p>Next, you will be asked what you want contributors to do for your project. You can create task requests addressed to contributors specialized in many different areas, as seen in the image below.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/tasks_categories.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
            <p>Choose the one most appropriate for your task request and read the rules so that your task request will be accepted by the moderators.</p>
            <p>Once you have read the rules and understood them, click <strong>I understand. Proceed.</strong></p>
